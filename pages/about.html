                    This is a very personal project. It's regarding my closet and my style 
                    and the things I want, need and have. I have always had an interest in clothing and textiles, 
                    more so than an interest in fashion and trends. This website serves two functions: firstly, to create 
                    a visual structure of what I need to buy, make and mend, and secondly to practice on creating 
                    websites. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have a lot of thoughts related to style and clothing and I need somewhere to sort it out, so I 
                    might add some type of blog typ section here. A few years back I started a company where I focused on 
                    creating sustainable fashion in small quantities, mostly unique objects with hand embroidery, painted patterns 
                    and plant dyed fabrics. Then I ran headfirst in to wall, as we say in Sweden. I worked, studied full time and                         
                    ran a company on the side. One day I woke up and was unable to get out of bed. Months of pushing through the tiredness, 
                    the anxiety and ignoring all types of signs that I was doing well had caught up with me. It took me years to get back 
                    to a place where I feel good about myself and my situation. During these years I kind of lost a lot of myself and my 
                    creativity. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    So this project is a way of getting back in to it. To structure my thoughts and my feelings and all of the things that 
                    are related to clothing and style. And there is a lot, from expressing yourself to environmental issues to working 
                    conditions in the fashion industry.
