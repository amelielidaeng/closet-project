                <p class="card-text">
                    This is a very personal project. It's regarding my closet and my style 
                    and the things I want, need and already have. I have always had an interest in clothing and textiles, 
                    more so than an interest in fashion and trends. This website serves two functions: firstly, to create 
                    a visual, structured list of what I need to buy, make and mend, and secondly to practice on creating 
                    websites. 
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    I have a lot of thoughts related to style and clothing and I need somewhere to sort it out, so I 
                    might add some type of blog typ section here. A few years back I started a company where I focused on 
                    creating sustainable fashion in small quantities, mostly unique objects with hand embroidery, painted patterns 
                    and plant dyed fabrics. Then I ran head-first in to the wall, as we say in Sweden. I worked, studied full time and                         
                    ran a company on the side. One day I woke up and was unable to get out of bed. Months of pushing through the tiredness, 
                    the anxiety and ignoring all types of signs that I wasn't doing well had caught up with me. It has taken me years to get back 
                    to a place where I feel good about myself and my situation. During these years I kind of lost a lot of myself and my 
                    creativity. 
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    So this project is a way of getting back in to it. To structure my thoughts and my feelings and all of the things that 
                    are related to clothing and style. And there is a lot, from expressing yourself to environmental issues to working 
                    conditions in the fashion industry.

                    Who am I and what's the point?

                <p class="card-text">
                    My name is Amelie Lid√§ng and I am 35 years old. I am a mother of child and a dog and a sambo (cause all men are tiny babies 
                    and that is absolutely a hill I will die on). I have a background in fashion and textiles but I haven't been working in the 
                    industry for quite a few years. For some time now I've been stuck in a rutt and I need to connect to myself again. I have been thinking 
                    a lot about sustainability and how to be creative and keep a sense of style within the boundaries of sustainability. I've been 
                    seeing a lot of capsule wardrobes lately, but oftentimes they still seem to function around consumtion and seasonal changes. 
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    I have no interest in seasonal changes, nor have I any interest in consumtion. I am looking to have a closet that is functional for me and 
                    the life I live, with pieces that can be used throughout the year and be dressed up or down depending on the occasion. This is something 
                    that I have been thinking about for quite some time and it is one if my most used and updated spreads in my bullet journal. 
                    This is a work in progress and could be understood in a plethora of ways, as a to do list, a moodboard, a personal style journal. 
                    To me, it is still very unclear but I'll go ahead and see where it ends up.
